# Auditory Scanning Application

## What is the Application?

The project is application for reading lists in a flowchart ('Auditory scanning').
There are people that "trapped inside their bodies" and cannot speak because of physical limitations, some use computers with eye tracking systems, but not all are able to use these cameras for all sorts of reasons, and not all the time.
The method to communicate with them is quite complicated - the therapists prepare ahead a list of everyday messages in the notebook and reading them to the patient until he signals to the therapist what he is referring to.
For example, the patient wants to call someone/say that something is bothering him/ask a question/eat - say that the patient marked 'yes' to 'eat' then he will open a menu for food
where he will be asked whether he wants to eat â€“ cooked food/vegetables/fruits/drinks, etc'.
Also, if the patient said yes to drinking, the drinking menu opens up and asks him about the types of drinking and so on.
